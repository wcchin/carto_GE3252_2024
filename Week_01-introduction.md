#### 1. Course Overview
This course covers .red.underline[the art, science, and ethics of mapmaking and map use]. It aims to introduce students the design principles and techniques for creating maps with contemporary mapping tools. Topics covered include conceptualisation of geographic phenomena, projection and distortion, geospatial data manipulation and presentation, thematic map design, interactive geographic visualization, and emerging trends in cartography and geovisualisation. The course emphasises effective visual thinking and visual communication with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It is mounted for students with interests .red.underline[in GIS and map design as a medium for communication].

#### 8. Policies
- .red[[IMPORTANT]] .mark[All teaching materials (e.g., lecture pptx, lab handouts, quizzes, videos) are copyrighted.] Selling or buying such materials is prohibited. If you would like to use the teaching materials for any other purpose (e.g., in your future job for training others), please inform the course coordinator, because the IP rests with faculty. Disciplinary action will be taken should any attempted is found to sell/buy the teaching materials and/or distribute them without the course coordinator's consent. 
- The lab assignments that you submit .mark[must be your OWN work.] Copying otherâ€™s files for submission is forbidden. Please refer to NUS Code of Student Conduct and NUS Libraries Guides for what plagiarism is. If you are unsure, speak to the lecturer for clarification.
- If you miss any of the lab sessions or tests, .mark[your assignment/make-up test request will not be accepted and you will get 0 mark for that CA item]. The only exception is you submit an official letter from NUS or government agency where you are involved in during the class time, and this must be done one week before the affected class. 
- Attend the lab session that you are registered in, as there may be questions to submit during the lab session. .mark[Switching lab sessions is not allowed unless approved in advance by the lecturer.]

#### 8. Policies
- Late submission of assignments will result in .mark[a deduction of 1 mark per day]. No submission will be accepted five days after the due day. You are responsible for submitting the final correct file. Submission of .mark[wrong files/maps will NOT be accepted as an excuse for late submission].
- If there is .mark[any question regarding the marks] that you receive for your lab assignment, please speak to the lecturer/TA in charge. This must be done within three days after the assignment is returned to you. 
- Please .mark[check your NUS email regularly] for any update regarding the course.
- [Guidelines on the Use of AI Tools For Academic Work](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-5) and [A General Message to Our Students on the Use of AI Tools](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-4):
    - Copy-paste from AI output is considered plagiarism; 
    - Using AI in (self-)learning processes (basic knowledge, proofreading/editing, etc.) is okay;
    - Acknowledging your use of AI;
    - You are responsible for your work.

].column[.justify[
These fiction maps contain:
- the locations of events/scenes
    - relative locations, distances, spatial differences

    - the time dimension 
- interactions between the people
    - social networks

A map is a tool for telling a story, a medium for communicating.

### Thinking exercise: Variable selection
.small[
Letâ€™s say you are drawing a map of disease distribution, and there are two options, direct count or incidence rate. Below is an example of two zones/spatial units within the map: 

Given the population size:
- Zone A: 10k
- Zone B: 1k

.split-50[.column[
At the early stage:

- Zone A: 5 patient
- Zone B: 5 patient

.mark[This indicated a similar severity level between the two zones.]

What if we calculate per 1000 people incidence rate?

- Zone A: 5/10k = 0.0005 = 0.05%
- Zone B: 5/1k = 0.005 = 0.5%

.mark[This suggested 10x differences between the two zones.]
].column[
2 years later, when the disease is everywhere, the number of cases in one week:

- Zone A: 1000 patient
- Zone B: 500 patient

.mark[Zone A doubled the size of Zone B]

The incidence rate (per 1000 people):

- Zone A: 1000/10k = 0.1 = 10% of the population are infected
- Zone B: 500/1k = 0.5 = 50% of the population are infected

.mark[Zone A is less than Zone B]
